## App

## Timeline

- Controller endpoint name bleeds outside of the box
- On hover, event tooltip
- With a large number SQL queries, alot of wasted visual space (stairway to hell)
  - Idea #1: Only Queries with **multiple** occurrences get their own row?
- Initial zoom level seems doesn't seem to zoom in on the data set
- "Sticky" event set (controller name)
  - currently the controller name scrolls out of view


## Summary

- Breakdown of tables
- Tooltip is cutoff


## Details

- When activeRecord.instantation is selected don't show sql panel
