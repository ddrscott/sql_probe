# TODOs

## App

- consistent event/sql-query coloring
  - The user needs to be able to correlate events in the Timeline and the pie slice aggregates in the Summary

## Panel

- Don't use flex, just percentages
  - Right now when the Summary explodes with many different sql queries it pushes
    the panel up.

## Timeline

- zoom centered at mouse
- can't pan all the way to the right when zoomed in
- "Sticky" event set (controller name)
  - currently the controller name scrolls out of view


## Summary

- Tooltip is cutoff
